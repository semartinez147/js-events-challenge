		<p> <!--The Iliad by Homer-->
			At Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in Phocoea, by whose assistance he at
			length, after some difficulty, reached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure, which we
			will continue in the words of our author. “Having set out from Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries
			of some goats that were pasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus (for that was
			the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from
			Homer. For some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a place alone, and what
			could be his design in coming. He then went up to him, and inquired who he was, and how he had come to
			desolate places and untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting to him the whole
			history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion; and he took him, and led him to his cot, and having
			lit a fire, bade him sup.</p>

		<p> <!--The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling-->
			Father Wolf waited till his cubs could run a little, and then on the night of the Pack Meeting took them and
			Mowgli and Mother Wolf to the Council Rock--a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred
			wolves could hide. Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack by strength and cunning, lay out at
			full length on his rock, and below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from badger-colored
			veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black three-year-olds who thought they could. The Lone Wolf
			had led them for a year now. He had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth, and once he had been beaten
			and left for dead; so he knew the manners and customs of men. There was very little talking at the Rock. The
			cubs tumbled over each other in the center of the circle where their mothers and fathers sat, and now and
			again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub, look at him carefully, and return to his place on
			noiseless feet. Sometimes a mother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that he had not
			been overlooked. Akela from his rock would cry: “Ye know the Law--ye know the Law. Look well, O Wolves!” And
			the anxious mothers would take up the call: “Look--look well, O Wolves!”

		<p> <!--The Time Machine by H.G. Wells-->
			The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework, scarcely larger than a
			small clock, and very delicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance.
			And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his explanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely
			unaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room, and set
			it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew
			up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of
			which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the
			mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair
			nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace.
			Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched him in
			profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We
			were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and
			however adroitly done, could have been played upon us under these conditions.
