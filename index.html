		<p> <!--The Iliad by Homer-->
			<span draggable="true">At Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in Phocoea, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty, reached the little hamlet of Pithys</span>. <span draggable="true">Here he met with an adventure, which we will continue in the words of our author</span>. <span draggable="true">“Having set out from Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing</span>. <span draggable="true">The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out</span>. <span draggable="true">Glaucus (for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer</span>. <span draggable="true">For some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a place alone, and what could be his design in coming</span>. <span draggable="true">He then went up to him, and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate places and untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need</span>. <span draggable="true">Homer, by recounting to him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion; and he took him, and led him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade him sup.</span></p>

		<p> <!--The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling-->
			<span draggable="true">Father Wolf waited till his cubs could run a little, and then on the night of the Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and Mother Wolf to the Council Rock--a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred wolves could hide</span>. <span draggable="true">Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack by strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from badger-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black three-year-olds who thought they could</span>. <span draggable="true">The Lone Wolf had led them for a year now</span>. <span draggable="true">He had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth, and once he had been beaten and left for dead; so he knew the manners and customs of men</span>. <span draggable="true">There was very little talking at the Rock</span>. <span draggable="true">The cubs tumbled over each other in the center of the circle where their mothers and fathers sat, and now and again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub, look at him carefully, and return to his place on noiseless feet</span>. <span draggable="true">Sometimes a mother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that he had not been overlooked</span>. <span draggable="true">Akela from his rock would cry</span>: “<span draggable="true">Ye know the Law--ye know the Law</span>. <span draggable="true">Look well, O Wolves</span>!”<span draggable="true">And the anxious mothers would take up the call</span>: “<span draggable="true">Look--look well, O Wolves</span>!”

		<p> <!--The Time Machine by H.G. Wells-->
			<span draggable="true">The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made</span>. <span draggable="true">There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance</span>. <span draggable="true">And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his explanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing</span>. <span draggable="true">He took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug</span>. <span draggable="true">On this table he placed the mechanism</span>. <span draggable="true">Then he drew up a chair, and sat down</span>. <span draggable="true">The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon the model</span>. <span draggable="true">There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace</span>. <span draggable="true">Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder</span>. <span draggable="true">The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left</span>. <span draggable="true">The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist</span>. <span draggable="true">We were all on the alert</span>. <span draggable="true">It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played upon us under these conditions.</span>
